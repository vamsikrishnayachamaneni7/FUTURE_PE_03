# Chatbot Structure

This document explains the simple flow used to build the AI Travel Guide Chatbot in Landbot.

## 1. Welcome Block
The chatbot starts with a friendly greeting and asks the user where they want to travel or if they need destination ideas.

## 2. User Input Block
The user provides a destination or travel preference (example: Goa, budget trip, beach destination).

## 3. AI Response Block
The AI processes the input and gives travel suggestions or basic destination information.

## 4. Follow-Up Questions
To personalize the experience, the chatbot asks:
- Number of days
- Budget range (Budget / Mid / Luxury)
- Travel style (Solo / Friends / Family)

## 5. Travel Planning Block
Based on user inputs, the AI generates:
- A short day-wise itinerary
- Places to visit
- Food recommendations
- Budget and travel tips

## 6. End or Continue Block
The chatbot asks if the user wants to modify the plan or explore another destination.

## Summary
This structure keeps the chatbot simple, interactive, and easy to understand while providing useful travel guidance.
